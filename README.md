 **For a new probabilistic programming
language  designed  to  address  some  of  the  short-
comings of programming languages that aim at ad-
vancing and simplifying the development of AI sys-
tems. This language named Learning Based Java(lbjava) link: https://github.com/CogComp/lbjava

 
 *Relation Extraction (spatial and temporal together, person-location-time ) from raw web news text in different languages(English, German, Hindi). Different Natural Language Processing techniques and Machine Learning techniques are exercised. Feature Engineering was the most critical part that I already designed common to all experimenting languages. Experimented with Support Vector Machines and later Ensemble Learning. Before that I designed specialized annotation scheme to be applied on collected web data and finally collected in extensible markup language format for further application and improvement.
